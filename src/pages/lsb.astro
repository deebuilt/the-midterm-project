    <!-- The Pattern -->
    <div class="bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-xl p-8 mb-12">
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Every time the current administration needs to sell something ugly, they use the
        same three-step script. Different city, different person, same playbook.
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <!-- Step 1 -->
        <div class="flex gap-4">
          <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-gop flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-sm">L</div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Label first</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              They slap a scary label on someone who, by every right, deserves due process:
              "terrorist," "thug," "monster," "illegal." No evidence, no context, just a word
              designed to shut down empathy. If they can make people feel fear or disgust in one
              word, they don't need facts. The label is the shortcut. If people accept the label,
              they'll accept whatever happens next.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 2 -->
        <div class="flex gap-4">
          <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-tossup flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-sm">S</div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Story first, evidence later</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              They rush out a dramatic story before the full picture is available:
              "they attacked us," "we had no choice," "they lunged," "they reached."
              By the time real evidence surfaces &mdash; video, documents, witnesses &mdash;
              people are already attached to the movie-script version in their heads.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Step 3 -->
        <div class="flex gap-4">
          <div class="flex-shrink-0 w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-slate-600 flex items-center justify-center text-white font-bold text-sm">B</div>
          <div>
            <h3 class="font-bold text-lg mb-1">Blame shift</h3>
            <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed">
              When the story starts to fall apart, they never say "we were wrong." Instead,
              they blame someone else: mayors tied our hands, judges made this happen,
              protesters caused the chaos, "the left" is the real problem. The blame shift
              keeps the machine going and redirects people's anger at their enemies instead of
              at the lie.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="mt-8 pt-6 border-t border-white/10">
        <p class="text-white font-semibold">
          Label &rarr; Story &rarr; Blame. That's the script. Same pattern, new city, every time.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Why This Matters -->
    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-xs font-mono tracking-widest text-slate-400 uppercase mb-4">Why this matters</h2>
      <div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none">
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          This isn't a conspiracy theory. It's a well-documented communication strategy &mdash;
          and the current administration is using it with full force. They're good at it.
          They use the same rhetoric over and over: deny, deflect, never take accountability.
          It's not accidental. It's deliberate.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          And here's the problem: the other side &mdash; journalists, public officials, regular
          people trying to push back &mdash; they try to fight fair. They lead with facts,
          nuance, context. That's admirable, but it doesn't work against this. This isn't a
          good-faith debate. This is manipulation 101. And you don't counter manipulation by
          playing by the rules it's already broken.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Right now, we have a thousand different voices making a thousand different logical
          arguments about why what we're seeing is irrational. And every single one of them
          is right. But it's chaotic. It's scattered. Meanwhile, the other side repeats the
          same script every single time, and repetition is what sticks.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          That's where this comes in. Researchers call this approach
          <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-32962-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-dem hover:underline">prebunking</a>
          &mdash; basically, if you show people the trick before they encounter it, they're
          harder to fool. Think of it like a vaccine: a small dose of awareness that builds
          resistance before the real thing hits.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          The idea is simple. If we all learn to spot the same pattern and we all use the
          same language to call it out &mdash; <strong>Label, Story, Blame</strong> &mdash;
          then instead of a thousand scattered arguments, we become one voice. And one
          clear, repeated message cuts through in a way that a hundred different good points
          never will. We have to be as repetitive as they are. That's how this works.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Protest in the Comments -->
    <div class="mb-12">
      <h2 class="text-xs font-mono tracking-widest text-slate-400 uppercase mb-4">Protesting in the comments</h2>
      <div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none mb-6">
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          Now that you know the pattern, here's how you can actually use it. You don't have
          to be in the streets to protest. You can do it from your couch, in any comment
          section, on any platform.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Here's what most people don't think about: every time you scroll through the
          comments on a political video or post, you're not the only one reading. There are
          people sitting there silently &mdash; not commenting, not arguing, just watching.
          Some of them are tired. Some of them are confused. And as hard as it is to believe,
          some of them are genuinely on the fence. They see two sides screaming at each other,
          and they tune out. They don't know who to believe, so they believe nobody.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Those people are your audience. Not the troll. Not the person pushing the talking
          points. The quiet person in the middle who just needs a nudge &mdash; not an argument,
          not a lecture, just someone calmly pointing at what's happening and naming it.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="space-y-6">

        <div class="bg-slate-50 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Talk past the troll to the middle</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
            When you see LSB playing out in the comments, don't engage with the person pushing
            it. They're not going to change their mind, and that's fine &mdash; they were never
            your audience. Your audience is everyone else reading. Calmly name the pattern.
            That's it. You're not trying to win a debate. You're planting a seed for the person
            watching quietly.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-slate-50 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Call out the step, not the person</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
            Instead of "you're lying," try: "That's the label. Where's the evidence?" or
            "Story first, evidence later &mdash; I'll wait for the full picture." You're pointing
            to the pattern, not attacking the messenger. It's harder to dismiss and it gives
            the silent reader something concrete to hold onto.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-slate-50 rounded-lg p-6">
          <h3 class="font-bold mb-2">Repeat the phrases</h3>
          <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
            The power of propaganda is repetition. We counter it the same way. If every one of
            us uses the same phrases, in comments, in captions, in conversations, it starts to
            stick. That's the goal &mdash; make these words show up so often that people start
            recognizing the pattern on their own:

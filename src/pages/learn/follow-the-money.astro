        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="text-slate-600">
        DOGE stands for the <strong>Department of Government Efficiency</strong>. Despite the name, it is not actually a government department. It was created by <a href="/learn/executive-orders" class="text-dem hover:underline">Executive Order</a> 14158 on January 20, 2025&mdash;the same day the president took office. The order renamed an existing office called the U.S. Digital Service and put Elon Musk in charge as a "special government employee."
      </p>

      <div class="not-prose border-l-4 border-navy pl-4">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-navy">Why this matters</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-1">
          DOGE was not created by Congress. Nobody voted on it. Because it came from an executive order, a future president can shut it down with one signature. But while it exists, it has fired thousands of federal workers and canceled billions of dollars in contracts and grants.

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Congress's Role</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Congress did not create DOGE. But Congress did vote on the <strong>Rescissions Act (H.R. 4)</strong>, which turned $9.4 billion in DOGE spending cuts into permanent law. The House passed it by 2 votes. The Senate passed it by 3. That means this part of the story came down to a handful of members of Congress.

      <div class="not-prose bg-slate-50 rounded-xl p-5 border border-slate-200">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy mb-2">What is a rescission?</h4>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
          When the president wants to cancel money that Congress already approved, they send a "rescission request" to Congress. Congress has 45 days to vote yes or no. If Congress votes no (or doesn't vote at all), the money must be spent as originally planned. This rule comes from the <strong>Impoundment Control Act of 1974</strong>, a law passed after President Nixon tried to hold back money Congress had approved. (The <a href="/learn/congressional-hearings" class="text-dem hover:underline">Watergate hearings</a> that led to Nixon's resignation also drove the <a href="/learn/pacs-and-super-pacs" class="text-dem hover:underline">campaign finance reforms</a> that created the FEC.) You'll see this law come up again later in this article.

      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Before a single crypto bill was written, the industry made sure it would have a friendly audience. In the 2024 election, crypto companies and their <a href="/learn/pacs-and-super-pacs" class="text-dem hover:underline">super PACs</a> spent <strong>$245 million</strong>&mdash;more than the oil, pharma, or defense industries. The biggest spender was a super PAC called <strong>Fairshake</strong>, funded by three major crypto players: <strong>Coinbase</strong> (a crypto exchange), <strong>Ripple</strong> (a payments company), and <strong>Andreessen Horowitz</strong> (a venture capital firm that invests heavily in crypto startups).
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        What does "spending $245 million on an election" actually mean? It means running TV ads, digital ads, and mailers <em>for</em> candidates who support crypto-friendly laws&mdash;and <em>against</em> candidates who don't. Super PACs can spend unlimited money on these efforts as long as they don't coordinate directly with a candidate's campaign. (Read more about how this works in our <a href="/learn/pacs-and-super-pacs" class="text-dem hover:underline">PACs &amp; Super PACs</a> explainer.)
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Their strategy worked. Of the 58 races Fairshake targeted, <strong>91% of their preferred candidates won</strong>. Here are some of the biggest examples:

      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Here's where it gets uncomfortable. The president's family launched a crypto company called <strong>World Liberty Financial</strong> during the 2024 campaign. It created a stablecoin called <strong>USD1</strong>&mdash;which is exactly the kind of product the GENIUS Act regulates. The family's crypto holdings are reportedly worth about <strong>$5 billion</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        So the president signed a law that directly affects his own family's business. Democrats tried to add a rule that would bar the president and their family from profiting from crypto while in office. Republicans voted the amendment down.

        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-1">
          Whether you see this as smart business or a conflict of interest, the sequence is worth knowing: the crypto industry spent $245 million to elect a friendly Congress, that Congress passed crypto-friendly laws, and the president's family stands to profit from those laws. That's the money trail.

        <h3 class="font-bold text-navy">Why this matters</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-1">
          Under the <strong>Impoundment Control Act of 1974</strong>, the president cannot redirect money that Congress approved for something else. And Congress never approved $10 billion for the Board of Peace. Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) called the pledge "totally illegal." Whether it actually happens depends on whether Congress challenges it&mdash;or goes along with it.

      <div class="not-prose bg-slate-50 rounded-xl p-5 border border-slate-200">
        <h4 class="font-bold text-navy mb-2">What is the Impoundment Control Act?</h4>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
          A 1974 law that says the president <strong>must</strong> spend money the way Congress says to spend it. The president can ask Congress to cancel spending (that's a rescission&mdash;see the <a href="#doge" class="text-dem hover:underline">DOGE section above</a>). But the president cannot just redirect money to something else without asking. This law was passed after President Nixon tried to do exactly that. It's now at the center of both the DOGE story and the Board of Peace story.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">Where the Threads Meet</h3>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        This is where the three stories connect. DOGE cut <strong>$9.4 billion</strong> from domestic programs like foreign aid and public broadcasting. The crypto industry spent <strong>$245 million</strong> to shape its own regulation&mdash;and the president's family now profits from the laws that were passed. And <strong>$10 billion</strong> was pledged to an international body without a single vote in Congress.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        The common thread: enormous amounts of public money, moved with minimal involvement from the people's elected representatives. Whether through razor-thin votes, executive orders, or no vote at all.

        <h3 class="font-bold text-navy">What Congress can do</h3>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-1">
          Congress has the power to investigate DOGE spending through <a href="/learn/congressional-hearings" class="text-dem hover:underline">oversight hearings</a>. It can enforce the Impoundment Control Act. It can require disclosure of crypto conflicts of interest. The question is whether the members elected in 2026 will do any of that. That's where your vote comes in.

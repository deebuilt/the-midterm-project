      Your party registration might decide whether you get to vote before Election Day. Here's how.

        Before the general election in November, most states hold <strong>primary elections</strong>. Primaries are how each political party picks its candidates&mdash;the people whose names will actually appear on the ballot in November. But here's the thing a lot of people don't realize: <strong>not every state lets every voter participate in every primary.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        The rules about who can vote in a primary vary from state to state. Some states let anyone vote in any party's primary. Others say you can only vote in the primary of the party you're registered with. And if you're registered with a third party&mdash;or not registered with any party at all&mdash;you might be shut out of both.
      </p>

      <!-- WHY PRIMARIES MATTER -->
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why Does This Matter?</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Primaries decide who ends up on the November ballot. In many districts, the primary is actually <em>more</em> important than the general election. If a district is heavily Democratic or heavily Republican, whoever wins that party's primary is almost guaranteed to win in November. So if you can't vote in the primary, you're missing the election that actually matters most.
      </p>
      <div class="not-prose bg-tossup/10 border border-tossup/30 rounded-lg p-5">
        <p class="text-sm font-medium text-tossup">
          In the 2022 midterms, only about 20% of eligible voters participated in primary elections nationwide. In many races, a small fraction of voters chose the candidates the rest of us had to pick between.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- TYPES -->
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Main Types of Primaries</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        There are several types, but they all answer the same question: <strong>Who is allowed to vote in each party's primary?</strong>
      </p>

        <div class="bg-dem-light rounded-xl p-5 border border-dem/20">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-dem-dark mb-2">Open Primary</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Any registered voter can choose which party's primary to vote in, regardless of their own party registration. You pick a party's ballot at the polls. You can only pick one party per election. Many open-primary states don't even have party registration at all.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="bg-gop-light rounded-xl p-5 border border-gop/20">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-gop-dark mb-2">Closed Primary</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Only voters who are registered with a party can vote in that party's primary. If you're a registered Democrat, you get a Democratic ballot. If you're a registered Republican, you get a Republican one. If you're not registered with either party, you don't get to vote in either primary.
          </p>

        <div class="bg-slate-50 rounded-xl p-5 border border-slate-200">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-navy mb-2">Semi-Open Primary</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Unaffiliated or independent voters can choose which party's primary to vote in, but if you <em>are</em> registered with a party, you have to vote in your own party's primary. It's a middle ground.
          </p>

        <div class="bg-slate-50 rounded-xl p-5 border border-slate-200">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-navy mb-2">Semi-Closed Primary</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Each party gets to decide before the election whether to let unaffiliated voters participate. One party might say yes while the other says no. The rules can change from cycle to cycle.

          <h3 class="font-bold text-ind mb-2">Top-Two Primary</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            All candidates from all parties appear on one ballot, and every voter gets the same ballot. The top two vote-getters advance to the general election&mdash;even if they're from the same party. Used in <strong>California</strong> and <strong>Washington</strong>.

        <div class="bg-ind/10 rounded-xl p-5 border border-ind/20">

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Like top-two, but the top four candidates advance. The general election then uses ranked-choice voting. Currently used in <strong>Alaska</strong>, though a repeal initiative is on the 2026 ballot.

      <!-- WHAT ABOUT THIRD PARTIES -->
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What If You're Registered with a Third Party?</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        This is where it gets frustrating for a lot of voters. If you're registered as Libertarian, Green, Constitution Party, or any other third party in a <strong>closed primary</strong> state, here's what happens:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-600">
        <li>
          <strong>You cannot vote in the Democratic or Republican primary.</strong> You're locked out of both major-party nomination contests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>In semi-closed states, you might still be shut out.</strong> Some states only let <em>unaffiliated</em> voters into major-party primaries&mdash;not voters registered with a different party. Being registered Libertarian isn't the same as being unaffiliated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Your party might hold its own primary, convention, or caucus.</strong> If it does, you can participate. But many smaller parties don't hold traditional primaries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You can still vote on nonpartisan items</strong> that appear on the primary ballot&mdash;ballot measures, school board races, judicial races, and anything else that isn't tied to a party.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To vote in a major-party primary, you'd have to switch.</strong> You would need to change your party registration before the deadline, which means giving up your current affiliation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <div class="not-prose border-l-4 border-tossup pl-4 py-2">
        <p class="font-bold text-navy">The Florida example</p>
        <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-1">
          Florida is a closed primary state. If you're registered as a Libertarian in Florida, you can't vote in the Democratic or Republican primary. You'd only see nonpartisan races and ballot measures on your primary ballot. If you want to vote in a major-party primary, you need to change your registration at least 29 days before the election. Florida's 2026 primary is <strong>August 18, 2026</strong>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- DOES THIS APPLY TO GENERAL ELECTIONS -->
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Does This Apply to General Elections?</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        <strong>No.</strong> The open/closed distinction only applies to primary elections. In the general election (November), every registered voter can vote for any candidate from any party. The question isn't "who can vote"&mdash;it's "who gets to help decide which candidates make it to November in the first place."
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        That's an important distinction. Your right to vote in the general election is never restricted by party. But your ability to shape <em>who</em> appears on that ballot? That depends on where you live and how you're registered.
      </p>

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-2">

      <p class="text-slate-600">
        The long-term national trend has been modestly toward opening primaries. But the movement isn't one-directional&mdash;some states have opened up while others have closed down. In 2024 alone, 18 states considered legislation to change their primary rules.

      <!-- WHAT CAN YOU DO -->
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What Can You Do?</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-600">
        <li>
          <strong>Check your registration.</strong> Make sure you know what party (if any) you're registered with. You can check at
          <a href="https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-dem hover:underline">Vote.org</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Know your state's rules.</strong> Look up whether your state has open, closed, or semi-open primaries. Your state's Secretary of State website will have the current rules.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Know the deadlines.</strong> If you need to change your party registration to vote in a primary, there's usually a deadline weeks or months before the election. Don't wait until primary day.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vote in the primary.</strong> Most people skip primaries entirely. Showing up gives you a say in who ends up on the November ballot.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!-- BOTTOM LINE -->
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Primary elections decide which candidates make it to the general election&mdash;and depending on where you live, your party registration decides whether you get a voice in that process. In closed-primary states, voters registered with third parties or as independents are shut out of the contests that often matter most. In open-primary states, everyone gets to participate.

        If you've been paying attention to the news lately, you've probably heard the phrase "executive order" more than usual. In early 2025, executive orders started flying at a pace the country hadn't seen in nearly a century. But what actually <em>is</em> an executive order? How is it different from a law? And if Congress doesn't like one, can they do anything about it?
      </p>

      <!-- WHAT ARE THEY -->
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What Is an Executive Order?</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        An executive order is a written directive signed by the president that tells federal agencies how to do their jobs. Think of it this way: Congress writes the laws, and the president is in charge of carrying them out. Executive orders are one of the main tools a president uses to say, "Here's <em>how</em> I want these laws carried out."
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Executive orders have the force of law within the executive branch&mdash;meaning federal agencies <em>must</em> follow them. But they are <strong>not</strong> laws in the way that legislation passed by Congress is. A president can sign one without a single vote from anyone.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        The legal authority comes from
        <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artII-1/ALDE_00000243/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-dem hover:underline">Article II of the Constitution</a>,
        which says "the executive Power shall be vested in a President" and that the president "shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed." That's it. The Constitution never actually uses the words "executive order"&mdash;presidents have been filling in the blanks since George Washington.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Every executive order is numbered, published in the
        <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/presidential-documents/executive-orders" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-dem hover:underline">Federal Register</a>
        (the government's official daily journal), and becomes part of the public record. The numbering system was introduced in 1907 and retroactively applied back to an order issued by Abraham Lincoln in 1862.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Executive Orders vs. Laws: What's the Difference?</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        This is the most important distinction to understand. Here's a side-by-side comparison:

      <p class="text-slate-600">
        The bottom line: executive orders are <strong>fast but fragile</strong>. A president can act quickly and unilaterally, but the next president can undo everything just as fast. Laws are slow but durable&mdash;they require consensus but they stick.

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            The president acts <em>with</em> Congress's authorization. This is where presidential power is at its maximum&mdash;both branches agree.

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Congress hasn't spoken on the issue. The president may or may not have authority, depending on the circumstances.

        <div class="bg-red-50 rounded-xl p-5 border border-red-200">

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">

      <p class="text-slate-600">
        If you're thinking "wait, can a president just do whatever they want?"&mdash;the answer is no. The system of
        <a href="/learn/how-congress-works" class="text-dem hover:underline">checks and balances</a>
        gives Congress and the courts several ways to push back.

          <h3 class="font-bold text-navy">Pass a Law to Override It</h3>
          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Congress can pass a law that supersedes or blocks an executive order. If the president vetoes that law, Congress can override the veto with a two-thirds vote in both chambers. This is the most powerful check&mdash;but also the hardest, because it requires enough votes to overcome a veto.

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            This is sometimes called "cutting off the EO at its knees." Only Congress can appropriate federal funds. If Congress refuses to fund the implementation of an executive order, the order may exist on paper but can't actually be carried out. The

            passed in 1996, gives Congress a fast-track way to overturn executive branch regulations. Key features: CRA resolutions can pass the Senate with a <strong>simple majority</strong> (51 votes) instead of the usual 60 needed to break a filibuster. And if a CRA resolution becomes law, the agency is <strong>permanently barred</strong> from issuing a "substantially similar" rule.

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Federal courts can block or strike down executive orders that exceed presidential authority, violate the Constitution, or contradict existing law. This has happened throughout history&mdash;and it happened <a href="#recent" class="text-dem hover:underline">multiple times in 2025</a>. Lawsuits challenging executive orders can come from states, advocacy groups, or even individual citizens. If a court issues an injunction, the order is frozen until the legal challenge is resolved.

        If executive orders have suddenly been on your radar, there's a reason. The administration that took office on January 20, 2025 broke multiple historical records:

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-1">executive orders signed on <strong>day one</strong> alone&mdash;nearly triple the previous first-day record of 9</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-1">executive orders in the <strong>first 100 days</strong>&mdash;recent predecessors averaged roughly 15&ndash;25</p>

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600 mt-1">executive orders in <strong>calendar year 2025</strong>&mdash;the highest since FDR's 568 in 1933</p>

      <p class="text-slate-600">
        For context, the same president signed 220 executive orders across the <em>entire</em> previous four-year term (2017&ndash;2021). That total was surpassed in under 12 months of the current term.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">What Are the Recent Executive Orders About?</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Here are the major policy areas addressed by executive orders in 2025, described by topic rather than political framing:

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Reinstated Schedule F (reclassifying certain career federal employees to make them easier to hire and fire). Created the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) via executive order to cut government spending and reduce agency programs.

          <p class="text-sm text-slate-600">
            Imposed tariffs via emergency powers: 25% on goods from Canada and Mexico, 20% on goods from China. Established reciprocal tariff rates for over 60 countries. Expanded tariffs on steel, aluminum, and automobiles under national security authority.

      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Many of these orders have been challenged in court. Some have been temporarily blocked by federal judges. Others are moving through the legal system. This is the checks-and-balances framework in action: the president acts, and the courts and Congress decide whether those actions exceed presidential authority.

      <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS FOR MIDTERMS -->
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">Why This Matters for the 2026 Midterms</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Here's the thing about executive orders: they're powerful, but they're not permanent. The next president can reverse them. Courts can block them. And <strong>Congress can override them by passing laws</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        That's where
        <a href="/learn/what-are-midterms" class="text-dem hover:underline">midterm elections</a>
        come in. The members of Congress elected in 2026 will decide:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-slate-600">
        <li>Whether to codify executive orders into permanent law (making them survive future administrations)</li>
        <li>Whether to pass legislation blocking executive orders they disagree with</li>
        <li>Whether to fund or defund the agencies carrying out those orders</li>
        <li>Whether to use
          <a href="/learn/congressional-hearings" class="text-dem hover:underline">oversight hearings</a>
          to investigate how orders are being implemented</li>
        <li>Whether to use the Congressional Review Act to fast-track reversals of agency rules</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        In short: executive orders set the direction, but <strong>Congress holds the steering wheel</strong>. Who you send to Congress in 2026 determines what happens next.
      </p>

      <!-- BOTTOM LINE -->
      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Executive orders are a legitimate and long-used presidential tool, dating back to the founding of the republic. At their best, they've desegregated the military and enforced civil rights. At their worst, they've been used to intern American citizens. They're fast but fragile&mdash;powerful in the short term, but always subject to being reversed by the next president, overridden by Congress, or struck down by the courts.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600">
        Understanding what executive orders are&mdash;and what they <em>aren't</em>&mdash;is part of understanding how power works in the United States. They're not laws. They're not permanent. And the people you elect to Congress have real power to check them.

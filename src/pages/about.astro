          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Midterm Project is a free, open voter education site built for the 2026 U.S. midterm elections.
            We present candidates, their voting records, their positions, and their own words &mdash; so you can
            make informed decisions without having to wade through cable news spin or social media noise.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Every candidate page links directly to their official website and social media. Every voting record
            is sourced from public congressional data. We want you to go beyond this site &mdash; look things up,
            verify what we've written, and form your own conclusions.

      <!-- How We Approach It -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-xs font-mono tracking-widest text-slate-400 uppercase mb-4">How we approach it</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none">
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our content aims to be factual and nonpartisan. We cover every candidate &mdash; Democrat, Republican,
            and Independent &mdash; with the same format: their record, their positions, and links to learn more.
            We don't tell you who to vote for. We show you what they've done and let you decide.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            We believe that when people have real information, they make good choices. The problem isn't that
            voters are uninformed &mdash; it's that accurate, accessible information is getting harder to find.
            That's the gap we're trying to fill.
          </p>

      <!-- Where We Stand -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-xs font-mono tracking-widest text-slate-400 uppercase mb-4">Where we stand</h2>
        <div class="bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-xl p-8">
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We present all candidates fairly. But we are not neutral about democracy itself.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Right now, American democracy is under pressure. The free press is being attacked.
            Judges and election officials are being threatened. Executive power is expanding
            in ways that weaken the checks and balances our system depends on.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            These aren't partisan concerns. No matter who you vote for, you should be able to
            vote freely, have your vote counted, and trust that the people you elect are
            accountable to you &mdash; not the other way around.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Congress is the branch closest to the people. It has the power to push back on overreach,
            protect your rights, and hold anyone in government accountable. But only if we show up.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white font-semibold text-lg">
            That's why this project exists. Not to tell you what to think &mdash; but to make sure
            you have what you need to make your voice heard while you still can.
          </p>

            The Midterm Project was created on February 5, 2026, by a concerned citizen who believes
            that access to clear, factual political information shouldn't require a political science degree
            or a cable news subscription.

            This is a volunteer effort. It's not funded by any campaign, PAC, or political organization.

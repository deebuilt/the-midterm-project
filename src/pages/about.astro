          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            The Midterm Project is a free, open voter education site built for the 2026 U.S. midterm elections.
            We present candidates, their voting records, their positions, and their own words &mdash; so you can
            make informed decisions without having to wade through cable news spin or social media noise.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            Every candidate page links directly to their official website and social media. Every voting record
            is sourced from public congressional data. We want you to go beyond this site &mdash; look things up,
            verify what we've written, and form your own conclusions.

      <!-- How We Approach It -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-xs font-mono tracking-widest text-slate-400 uppercase mb-4">How we approach it</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none">
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            Our content aims to be factual and nonpartisan. We cover every candidate &mdash; Democrat, Republican,
            and Independent &mdash; with the same format: their record, their positions, and links to learn more.
            We don't tell you who to vote for. We show you what they've done and let you decide.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            We believe that when people have real information, they make good choices. The problem isn't that
            voters are uninformed &mdash; it's that accurate, accessible information is getting harder to find.
            That's the gap we're trying to fill.
          </p>

      <!-- Where We Stand -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-xs font-mono tracking-widest text-slate-400 uppercase mb-4">Where we stand</h2>
        <div class="bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-xl p-8">
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We present all candidates fairly. But we are not neutral about democracy itself.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The Midterm Project exists because we believe President Trump poses an unquestionable threat to
            American democracy. The erosion of democratic norms, the attacks on the free press, the attempts
            to undermine election integrity, the concentration of executive power &mdash; these are not partisan
            concerns. They are threats to the system that makes self-governance possible.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We built this site because the 2026 midterms are one of the most important elections in modern
            American history. Congress has the power to check executive overreach, protect voting rights,
            and hold power accountable. But only if we show up and vote.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Our position is simple: your right to vote freely and fairly must not be taken from you.
            Your vote must be counted. The institutions that protect your voice must be defended.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white font-semibold text-lg">
            That's why this project exists. Not to tell you what to think &mdash; but to make sure
            you have everything you need to make your voice heard while you still can.

            The Midterm Project was created on February 5, 2026, by a concerned citizen who believes
            that access to clear, factual political information shouldn't require a political science degree
            or a cable news subscription.

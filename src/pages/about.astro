            The Midterm Project is a free, open resource built to help people show up for the 2026
            U.S. midterm elections &mdash; especially people who have never voted in a midterm or
            primary before.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            The name has a double meaning. The midterms are coming, and they represent a real
            chance to shift power in the second half of this administration. But it's also a
            <em>group project</em> &mdash; the kind where it's pass/fail and everyone has a part to play.
            If we all pull together and do our part, the whole group wins.

      <!-- Why It Exists -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-xs font-mono tracking-widest text-slate-400 uppercase mb-4">Why it exists</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none">
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
            If you're watching what's happening right now &mdash; on the news, on social media,
            in your community &mdash; and you feel helpless, scared, or unsure what to do, this
            is for you. You're not alone, and you're not powerless.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            This project was started by someone who had only ever voted once every four years.
            Presidential elections felt like the big ones, and everything else felt optional.
            That was a mistake. The midterms are where we can actually make a difference &mdash;
            where local decisions, House races, and Senate seats get decided by the people who
            bother to show up.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            The goal here is simple: make 2026 the year you voted more times than you ever have
            in your life. Primaries, midterms, special elections, local races &mdash; all of it.

      <!-- Where We Stand -->

        <h2 class="text-xs font-mono tracking-widest text-slate-400 uppercase mb-4">Where we stand</h2>
        <div class="bg-slate-900 text-white rounded-xl p-8">
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Let's be honest about what this is.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            American democracy is under serious pressure. The free press is being attacked.
            Judges and election officials are being threatened. Executive power is expanding
            in ways that weaken the checks and balances our system depends on. People are
            being targeted, rights are being rolled back, and a lot of us are scared.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The goal of this project right now is to flip the House. That's where we can
            regain a check on this administration's power. Maybe someday this becomes a
            broader, nonpartisan voter education platform &mdash; and we'd be proud of that.
            But right now, we're focused on the most urgent thing: making sure the people
            who are unhappy with what's happening actually show up and vote.
          </p>
          <p class="text-slate-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We present candidates, their records, and their positions so you can make informed
            decisions. We link to official sources so you can verify everything yourself. But
            we're not going to pretend this is a neutral academic exercise. This is about
            using the power we have &mdash; our votes &mdash; while we still have it.
          </p>
          <p class="text-white font-semibold text-lg">
            Congress is the branch closest to the people. If enough of us show up, we can
            change the composition of the House, hold this administration accountable, and
            start putting things right.

            The Midterm Project was started on February 5, 2026, by a concerned citizen who
            decided that feeling helpless wasn't good enough anymore. It's a volunteer effort &mdash;
            no PAC money, no campaign funding, no political organization behind it.

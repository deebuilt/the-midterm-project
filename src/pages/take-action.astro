      You can't stop the executive orders. You can't undo what's already been done to
      innocent families in our communities. And that's terrifying. But you are not
      powerless, so get that out of your head.
      Here are things you can start doing today, at whatever level you're comfortable with.

          This is the most important thing on this list, and it's what The Midterm Project is
          about. Primaries, midterms, special elections, local races, ballot measures. All of it. We'll do our best to curate all of that information
          right here on this site.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If you're like most people, you vote once every four years. Make 2026 the year that
          changes. Set a personal record. This year, the goal is at least three trips to the
          ballot box: primaries, midterms, and whatever else comes up.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Stay informed &mdash; fight the algorithm</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Social media is designed to keep you scrolling, not keep you informed in the way
          that you should be. You might already notice this, but your feed tends to drift away
          from real news over time. One day you're watching breaking coverage, and the next
          day it's all sketches and rage bait.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Even if the news is hard to watch &mdash; and it is &mdash; don't keep your head in the
          sand. Follow reputable news sources and keep them in your algorithm. When you engage
          with real journalism, the algorithm shows you more of it.
        </p>
        <div class="bg-slate-50 rounded-lg p-5 space-y-3">
          <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-slate-800">Try this:</p>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Protest from home &mdash; in the comments</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          You don't have to argue with trolls. In fact, don't. The goal isn't to change the
          mind of the person you're replying to &mdash; it's to reach the people silently
          scrolling through the comments. The ones who are tired, confused, maybe on the
          fence. They need to see something other than two sides screaming at each other.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          When you see misinformation or bad-faith rhetoric, don't add fuel to the fire.
          Instead, calmly frame what's happening. Point out the pattern. Speak past the
          troll to the quiet people watching.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Keep talking about it</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Don't go quiet. Even if you can't stop what's happening, document it. Talk about it.
          Make content. Post. Share. Every creator who says "if you don't like me talking about
          politics, unfollow me" is doing exactly the right thing.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          We can't let this become normal. We can't let people forget. When we come through
          this &mdash; and we will, because that's how history works and because we're stronger
          than they think &mdash; the record will show who stood up and who looked away.
          Be someone who kept talking.

            <li class="flex items-start gap-2">
              <span class="text-dem font-bold mt-0.5">&rarr;</span>
              <span>Talk to people in real life &mdash; your family, friends, coworkers. A simple "are you registered?" or "do you know when the primary is?" goes further than any tweet.</span>

              <span class="text-dem font-bold mt-0.5">&rarr;</span>

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Show up in the streets</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Protesting has worked for decades &mdash; not always in the way people expect, but
          it works. You can't ignore hundreds of thousands of people in the streets saying
          the same thing. Whether or not it changes policy overnight, it stamps history.
          It says: we were here, we saw what was happening, and we did not sit quietly.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          If you can safely be there, be there. If you can't, support the people who can.
          Share their stories. Amplify their message. Every person who shows up makes the
          crowd louder.

        <h2 class="text-xl font-bold mb-3">Volunteer locally</h2>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Look around your community. There are organizations at every level &mdash;
          neighborhood groups, local chapters of national orgs, campaign offices for
          competitive races, civic engagement nonprofits. Shop around. See who needs help.
          Make yourself useful.
        </p>
        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          This doesn't have to be a forever commitment. Just make this a season where you

        <p class="text-slate-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Midterm races run on much smaller budgets than presidential campaigns. That means
          even small donations &mdash; $5, $10, $25 &mdash; go much further. If you can afford
          to give a little, direct it toward competitive House races. That's where the math
          is closest and where your money makes the biggest difference.
